<p>Arsenal have a lot of stars in their team. Players such as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, Granit Xhaka, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Mesut Ozil are all worth a lot of money</p>

<p>The one player for whom Arsenal paid the most amount of money is Nicolas Pepe. Then comes Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. That front three accumulated worthS £180m Arsenal have recently turned into a spendthrift side even though they are far behind some of their local rivals like Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool or even Chelsea</p>

<h1>List of three Expensive signings</h1>

<h2>Aubameyang</h2>

<img class="middle" src="images/Auba.jpg">

<p> Aubameyang is the second-most expensive player to ever sign for Arsenal in the clubs history. The reason behind paying such a high fee for a striker despite him being very close to his 30s was his goalscoring record with Borussia Dortmund.<p/>

<p>He finished his debut season in the Bundesliga with 16 goals across all competitions and then scored 25 goals in 46 appearances in his second season. The centre-forward saw the club through a DFL Pokal trophy win by beating Bayern Munich 3-1 in the finals. In July 2015, he signed a contract extension set to last till the summer of 2020.</p>

<p>The consecutive season, Aubameyang racked up yet another tally of 25 goals and finished second in the Bundesliga scorers list behind his professional nemesis but also close friend, Robert Lewandowski</p>

<h2>Ozil</h2>

<p> Wenger bought the attacking midfielder Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid, a move that has nearly trebled the clubs previous highest outlay on a player. The manager had expressed the confidence that Arsenals increased financial firepower would permit him to complete a deal for one of the biggest names on the market. At 10.30pm on Monday he could celebrate a coup.</p>
<h2>Pepe</h2>
